<p> COLUMBIA - The city’s five homicides in September have victims' family members mourning, residents frustrated and city leaders saying the community needs to come together to solve the problem.</p>
<p> Six people were fatally shot in 12 days last month. Five were ruled homicides.</p>
<p>The 10 total homicides this year are the most ever for the city, according to data that dates back to 2001.</p>
<p> According to data from the Missouri Department of Public Safety, violent crime is on pace to see its second decrease in two years. Violent crime, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, is defined as the frequency of murder, rape (including attempted), robbery and aggravated assault.</p>
<p>“The last month in Columbia has been very depressing,” said Mary Ratliff, president of the Columbia chapter of the NAACP. </p>
<p> Mayor Brian Treece said he feels “like there is a hurricane of violence hovering over our community right now.”</p>
<h2>What’s the impact? </h2>
<p> KOMU 8 News spoke with three families who lost loved ones to gun violence last month. </p>
<p> Vanita Marine lost her daughter Danielle Marine on Sept. 22.</p>
<p>"Me and my family just moved here from Texas. Two weeks. It’s hurting me to see. I just lost my baby and I’ve only been here two weeks," Marine said. </p>
<p> Kisha lost her brother Antonio Houston to gun violence that same night. She said some people choose to live a violent lifestyle.</p>
<p> "They might die within the lifestyle that they chose to live. But when it’s affecting mothers that have taken time to raise their children properly, when it’s affecting fathers that do anything they can to take care of their children," Kisha said.</p>

<p> Shaunda Hamilton lost her daughter Nadria Wright in a shooting on Sept. 13. </p>
<p> "She’s one of the innocent ones that were hurt because of the gun violence. She had a promising future,” Hamilton said. “She’s somebody that no one ever thought this would happen to. Sometimes it’s easy to ignore what’s happening in Columbia because you don’t think it’s going to affect you.”</p>

<p> They said Columbia was not this violent when they were growing up.</p>
<p>"We never had to worry about going outside and whether our kids were going to get killed in Columbia, Missouri,” Kisha said. “We didn’t have to worry about that, we didn’t have to worry about walking home from a center party or whether my grandmother had to think I was going to die on the way to her house.” </p>
<p> Hamilton said, "I grew up in Columbia and it’s always been known as a good place to raise your children and retire, and a good community. When you think of Columbia, you don't think of the place you move to when you want to die."</p>
<p> Rev. James Gray holds the title of <a href= "the city's unofficial children's funeral organizer. "target="_blank" src="https://www.komu.com/news/columbia-reverend-reflects-on-the-tragedy-of-children-s-funerals"</a> He has not lost a loved one this month, but said he's still in pain.</p>
<p>"I’m here because over the years I’ve looked into too many mother’s eyes and felt their pain,” Gray said. “I’ve looked into too many father’s eyes and felt their pain. I looked at too many people in the neighborhood and felt their pain.” </p>
