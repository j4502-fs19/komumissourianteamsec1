        <div id="intro2">
          <p>The University of Missouri School of Journalism is host to three professional newsrooms for mid-Missouri: the Columbia Missourian, KBIA 91.3 and KOMU. These three newsrooms serve as the main sources of breaking and in-depth news for print, radio and television news in Columbia and the surrounding counties. Our goal with Columbia Collaboration is to put the three newsrooms together and provide multi-dimensional, in-depth reporting and coverage. Here you will find the collaborative pieces between print, radio and television that give mid-Missourians a full-sided story.</p>

          <p>The Columbia Missourian is Columbia's go-to source for digital and print news. It's award winning features, news stories and photography brings the print and photo side to the colaborative pieces.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.kbia.org/"><img src="img/kbia.png" alt="KBIA Home Page" width="100%"/></a></p>
          <p>KBIA is mid-Missouri's NPR member station. It's award-winning and nationally recognized audio pieces bring an element to collaboration that most newsrooms don't include.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.komu.com/home/"><img src="img/komu.png" alt="KOMU Home Page" width="100%"/></a></p>
          <p>KOMU is Columbia's NBC affiliate broadcast television station. It's in-depth community reporting attracts an audience that print and radio might not appeal to, and allows for that audience to get in-depth reporting in their prefered consumption of news.</p>
